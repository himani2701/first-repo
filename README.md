TASK 3-

Work flow for the whole tenure:
1. Frequency Decision and Planning
• Team and Lead Discussion: Start by holding a meeting with my
content team and the GDGC lead to discuss the ideal posting
frequency.
• Analyse the posting patterns and engagement metrics of other
successful clubs on Medium.
• Determine if posting once a month is sufficient, or if more

frequent posts during key tech events are necessary (like bi-
weekly during major tech weeks).

• Consider team capacity and the quality of content while setting
realistic goals.

2.Domain Analysis and Topic Distribution

• Analyse Major Tech Domains: Conduct research on what
tech domains are trending and of interest to our college
students like AI/ML, Blockchain, Web3, Cloud Computing,
Cybersecurity, etc.
• Utilize sources like social media trends, tech newsletters,
hackathon themes, and recent innovations to guide the
analysis.
• Team Interest Mapping:
o Gather insights from team members about their
preferred areas of tech.
o Align their interests with the trending topics to ensure
that each team member is assigned blog topics they
are passionate about.

• Topic Assignment: Distribute topics based on the results of the
analysis. For Example-
▪ Person A: AI/ML-related blog.
▪ Person B: Event coverage on hackathons.
▪ Person C: Emerging technologies like Web3 or Blockchain.

3. Content Creation:
• Writers draft blog posts: Provide a structure template for consistency
(introduction, body, conclusion, and CTA).
• Editors review posts for quality, ensuring content is free from
grammatical errors and factually accurate.
• Technical Reviewers (senior members or leads) ensure technical
accuracy and add value with additional insights.
• Designers create graphics, banners, and visual elements to
accompany the blog posts. (code snippets, infographics, etc.)

4. Publishing (Bi-weekly/Monthly)
• Schedule blog posts on the agreed publishing dates.
• Optimize for SEO by using relevant keywords, proper tags, and
including links to previous blog posts or related resources.

5.Cross-promotion
• Share the Medium blogs across GDGC VIT Bhopal’s social media
platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub).
• Share snippets or key takeaways in newsletter emails to increase
engagement.
• Encourage authors to promote their blogs on their personal
accounts to widen reach.
6. Encourage Reader Interaction

• Enable claps, comments, and interactions on the Medium page.
• Respond to comments to build a sense of community.
• Consider introducing a call-to-action (CTA) at the end of each post
asking readers to share their thoughts or suggest future topics.

7. Track Metrics and Performance (Monthly)
• Use Medium analytics to track views, reads, claps, and shares for
each blog post.
• Review engagement and analyse which topics perform well.
• Adjust the content strategy based on the analytics (e.g., more
tutorials if they perform well)
8. Team Review Sessions (Monthly)

• Hold monthly retrospectives with the content team to discuss
what worked and what didn’t.
• Implement improvements in writing style, technical depth, or
promotion strategies

During weeks or months featuring club events, Google events, or hackathons,
our content will centre around these exciting topics, with an increased posting
frequency to ensure we capture and share relevant updates, insights, and
recaps that engage our community and showcase our active involvement in the
tech landscape.

TASK 4-

Very warm welcome to all the tech enthusiasts, innovators, and future leaders!
It's an absolute pleasure to welcome you all to this electrifying event hosted by
the dynamic team here at GDGC VIT Bhopal. Today is a day to ignite our
passion for technology, unleash our creativity, and celebrate the spirit of
innovation that leads us forward. Let's learn, collaborate, and break boundaries
in what's possible.
The Google Developer Groups Club is not just a name but a global movement
among developers, designers, and those with some tech enthusiasm who are
driven by the act of wanting to share knowledge, skills, and the ability to create
cutting-edge projects. For those familiar, it is more than a community, it’s an
initiative that brings together developers, designers, and tech lovers from all
around. This is where it all happens, the melting pot of all tech brilliance and
endless possibilities, and here at VIT Bhopal, our club is that innovation hub
that emerges from endless workshops, hackathons, and networking
opportunities.
So let me introduce you to our amazing lead: [Name of Lead]. He/she is a true
visionary leader of our community in GDG. Under [Name of Lead] leadership,
we have really seen the chapter hit new heights. And so far, we have had some
engaging workshops, thrilling hackathons, and a well-functioning lively
technology ecosystem thriving under [Name of Lead]. We all have had
tremendous growth in our GDG chapter with [Name of Lead]. I would like to
extend hearty gratitude to our super incredible faculty coordinator as well,
[Name of Faculty Coordinator], who was the strength behind our journey and
provided the core support that drove us through. The guidance and mentorship
he gave us to the resources he helped find were exactly what we needed for
such events, and that is the kind of treatment we received from our
Coordinator, [Name of Faculty Coordinator].
Today is much more than an event; it's really a celebration of our passion for
technology, the showcase of our boundless creativity and testament to the
power of community-and I am so thrilled to see this diverse and enthusiastic
audience that has gathered here today to celebrate technology, innovation, and
community. Now, I hope we inspire you in these fields of trying new things, to

work with like-minded folks who want to stretch the frontiers of what is
possible in terms of technology.
Thank you so much for joining us on this exciting ride. Let's dive right in, soak
up all the excitement, and make this event one of those once-in-a-lifetime
experiences of learning, networking, and pure tech magic.
